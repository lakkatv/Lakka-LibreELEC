## Upstream licensing
As Lakka includes code from many upstream projects it includes many copyright owners. Patches to upstream code have the same license as the upstream project, unless specified otherwise. For a complete copyright list please checkout the source code to examine license headers. 

## Contributions fall under GPLv2
Unless expressly stated otherwise all code submitted to the Lakka project in any form is licensed under GPLv2 and copyright is donated to Lakka/libretro. This approach allows the project to stay manageable in the long term by giving us freedom to maintain the code as part of the whole without the management overhead of preserving contact with every submitter, e.g. GPLv3.
